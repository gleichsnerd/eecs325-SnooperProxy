proxyd - The lightweight Java proxy

Port used: 5019
Tested on: Google Chrome for OSX10.10
Websites tested:
www.cnn.com
www.reddit.com
www.stackoverflow.com
www.docs.oracle.com


To Compile:
proxyd uses an external Thread class, ProxyThread.java. Although it would be ideal for ProxyThread to be recompiled when
proxyd is, class files will be included in the submission so you don't have to worry about it.


To Run:

proxyd will default to port 5019 when no arguments are given.

proxyd will accept one argument:

  -port <port number>

For example:

java proxyd -port 50025

**Important note**
This proxy isn't efficient and will like to take time to load large HTTP response bodies, i.e. large images or video frames.
Please be patient, it will load text and images in due time.

**Another Important node**
The nature of the beast is that the browser will continue sending requests for content even after you hit stop or try to open
a new page. Unfortunately, this means that opening a complex page (like cnn.com) and then switching to a new website (such as
stackoverflow.com) will take a while since the proxy port is still being clogged with requests for the old page.
